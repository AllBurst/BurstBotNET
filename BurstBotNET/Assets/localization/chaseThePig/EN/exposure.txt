Exposure is a process during which you can choose to let all other players know that you have certain cards.
By allowing other players to know that you hold special cards, the effect of the exposed special card will be doubled.

The effect of exposure is global, which means when you hold the card and choose to expose it, during the game whoever wins a turn and gets that card will be subject to the effect of exposure.
**Since <:burst_heart2:930749955914727474> Heart A affects all Hearts, when exposed, all Hearts won by each player will be doubled.**

In addition, if the card you choose to expose is the first card you got (which can be seen in the initial message of the game), the effect will be further doubled.
The following is the effects of each special card and the intensified effects thereof after they are exposed.

<:burst_spade2:930749903158792192> **Spade Q (Pig)**
- *Not exposed* - Negative 100 (-100) points
- *Exposed* - Negative 200 (-200) points
- *Exposed as the first card* - Negative 400 points 

<:burst_diamond2:930749987044851712> **Diamond J (Goat)**
- *Not exposed* - Positive 100 points
- *Exposed* - Positive 200 points
- *Exposed as the first card* - Positive 400 points

<:burst_heart2:930749955914727474> **Heart A**
- *Not exposed* - All Hearts will have their original negative points.
- *Exposed* - All Hearts' negative points are doubled.
- *Exposed as the first card* - All Hearts' negative points are doubled again (4x).

<:burst_club2:930750022167957504> **Club 10 (Transformer)**
- *Not exposed* - All positive and negative points are doubled, or +50 points if acquired alone with other non-scoring cards.
- *Exposed* - All positive and negative points are multiplied by 4, or +100 points if acquired alone.
- *Exposed as the first card* - All positive and negative points are multiplied by 8 (2 to the power of 3), or +200 points if acquired alone.

As a general rule, **players who expose their cards won't be able to play that card if the first turn is that suit.**
For example, if you choose to expose <:burst_spade2:930749903158792192> Spade Q and the first player plays a Spade card in the first turn, you won't be able to play Spade Q in that turn.
