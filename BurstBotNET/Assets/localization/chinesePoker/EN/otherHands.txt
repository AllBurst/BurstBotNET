<:burst_club2:930750022167957504> **Four of a kind**: 4 cards with the same rank, plus 1 card with a different rank. E.g. *6 6 6 6 Q*. **Setting your middle hand with a Four-of-a-kind and win against another player's middle hand will grant you additional 8 units. If you set it in your back hand, the additional units are halved.**
<:burst_spade2:930749903158792192> **Straight flush**: 5 cards with the same suit and sequential ranks. **Setting your middle hand with a Straight-flush and win against another player's middle hand will grant you additional 10 units. If you set it in your back hand, the additional units are halved.**

**Be careful! Your middle hand has to be smaller than or equal to your back hand; otherwise, it's a mis-set.**
For example, you should not put a four-of-a-kind in your middle hand, then put a full-house in your back hand.
**Mis-setting hands is considered as being scooped by all other players, and you will lose bet to all other players!**
