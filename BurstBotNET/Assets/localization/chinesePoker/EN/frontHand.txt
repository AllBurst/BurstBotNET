The front hand consists of 3 cards in total. Players are required to set 3 cards in order to compete with other players' front hands.

Since front hand only has 3 cards, possible combinations are as follows.

<:burst_spade2:930749903158792192> **High card**: 3 different cards in terms of numbers (ranks) and suits.
<:burst_heart2:930749955914727474> **One pair**: 2 cards with the same rank, plus 1 card with a different rank.
<:burst_diamond2:930749987044851712> **Three of a kind**: 3 cards with the same rank. **Setting your front hand with a Three-of-a-kind and win against another player's front hand will grant you 3 additional units.**

**Be careful! Your front hand has to be smaller than your middle hand and back hand; otherwise, it's a mis-set.**
For example, you should not put a three-of-a-kind in your front hand, then put a one-pair in your middle/back hand.
**Mis-setting hands is considered as being scooped by all other players, and you will lose bet to all other players!**
