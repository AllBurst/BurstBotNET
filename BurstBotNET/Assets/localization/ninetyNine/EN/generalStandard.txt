**Rules**
- The rank of the **normal cards** the player played will be added to the current total.
- If all of player's normal cards will cause the current total to exceed 99 when played, and the player doesn't have any **special cards**, the player loses the game.
- The last player who still have cards to play will be the winner.

**Cards**：
*Normal cards*：
A **(except for <:burst_spade2:930749903158792192> Spade A)**, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9

*Special cards*：
<:burst_spade2:930749903158792192> Spade A - Set the current total to 0 (zero).
4 - Reverse the current turn direction, *i.e. P1 -> P2 -> P3 to P1 <- P2 <- P3*.
