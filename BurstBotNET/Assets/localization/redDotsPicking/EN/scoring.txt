Generally, only <:burst_heart:910826529511051284> Hearts and <:burst_diamond:910826609576140821> Diamonds are counted into the final score.
However, **in a 4-player game, <:burst_spade:910826637657010226> Spade A is 30 points, and <:burst_club:910826578336948234> Club A is 40 points.**

When the game ends, a player that gets 250 points satisfies a "win-all" (全贏) situation, and automatically gets 420 points as his final score, while all other players' final scores will be -140 points.
A player that gets 0 points in total (excluding the minus points from a player earning Heart 5 and Diamond 5) when the game ends satisfies a "zero-attempt" (拼零分) situation, and will be rewarded the same way as win-all (while all other players' final scores will also be -140 points.)

If there's neither a win-all situation nor a zero-attempt situation, players' final scores will be calculated according to the total number of players:

1. 2 players - Earned scores minus 105 points.
2. 3 players - Earned scores minus 70 points.
3. 4 players - Earned scores minus 70 points.

However, if a player has a negative score before calculating the final score, starting from the player who gets a Heart 5 and a Diamond 5, all players will be yielding their scores to the player(s) with negative scores, until their scores become at least zero.
The order is as follows, or until all players with negative scores get at least a score of 0, whichever comes first:

1. The player who has got a Heart 5 and a Diamond 5 will yield his scores until his score becomes 70.
2. The player with the highest score will yield his score until his score is equal to the player who has the second-highest score.
3. This process continues until it reaches the player who has the lowest positive score, who will then evenly yield his score until all players have at least a score of 0.
